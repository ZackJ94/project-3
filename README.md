# UOCIS322 - Project 3 #

## Project Completed by Zack Johnson

## How to Use
Build and launch the container using the included Dockerfile. Access the container via `localhost:5000` (unless otherwise specified in a provided .ini file).

The player must identify words from the wordbank that can be spelled using the letters in the jumble below the wordbank. Upon successfully entering a word, it will be listed below the textbox.
When the player has found 3 words, the game is over.

A full description of the app can be found below

## Overview
The program is a simple anagram game designed for English-learning students in elementary and middle school. It presents a list of words to students and an anagram. The anagram is a jumble of some of the words, which are randomly chosen. Students attempt to type words that can be created from the jumble. When a matching word is typed, it is added to a list of solved words.

The vocabulary word list is fixed for one invocation of the server, so multiple students connected to the same server will see the same vocabulary list but may have different anagrams.

## FAQ
### What is `src`?
This is a sub-package which contains modules related to the game. You should not make any changes there, but feel free to review them to get a better understanding.

### What is `data`?
This directory contains a few word lists in the form of text files. You should not make any changes to the ones that already exist. However, you can add your own (but don't have to). You can change the word list file in your `credentials.ini`.

### What is minijax?

`flask_minijax.py`, along with its template `templates/minijax.html`, is a tiny example of using JQuery with flask for an AJAX application. They should not be included in the version of the project you turn in. You can use this example to figure out how to implement an AJAX version of the game. Delete the two (along with `static/img`) when you're done with the project.

### How do I run the tests?
The `tests` directory contains a test suite for the `src` package. There's a `run_tests.sh`, which you can run in your container while it's running. However, it is not required, since you will not be changing anything in `src`.
